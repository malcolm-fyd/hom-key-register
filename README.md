Build a key sign out register for an apartment complex.

I will be using a Cloudflare Worker, Page, and DB

It needs to operated in a browser on an iPad

It needs to have a report page that will generate a neat report for printing.

Information required to be recorded will be

Name, business, mobile number (with checking) Key number, selection of a range of key types (like lift, master, roof, apartment (with number), signature of person taking the key.

It needs to have the same look and feel are the hom-signin-system we built earlier.
